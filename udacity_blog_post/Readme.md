### Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data to better understand:

. What are the ratings and prices of different locations in Seattle?

. How well can we predict a property’s price? What aspects correlate well to price?

. How well can we predict a property’s availability? What aspects correlate well to availability?


### File Descriptions

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. One of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. The other one has helper functions. Markdown cells and comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

### Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available at this link ( https://medium.com/@javier_61720/insights-from-seattle-airbnb-data-897145c65955)

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at this Kaggle link ( https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data ) . Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
